### Hi there! 😁 

My name is Rodrigo Rosa from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Back-End Developer since 2018 and currently i'm Java Developer at [Nostrum Consultoria e Projetos](https://www.nostrum.com.br/). I'm passionate about tecnology and codes.  In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺),  to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I love chatting with friends and family with a cold beer (🍺).  Would you like to find me?
